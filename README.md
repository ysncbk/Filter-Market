Filtering the Market Using Technical Analysis Indicators

DAX (Germany) and BIST30 (Turkey) are 2 main indexes from different stock exchanges. Each of them consists of major companies listed in the related stock exchange. Each of them include 30 components. Investors or traders can focus on specific stocks and miss other opportunities that also satisfy their conditions. That is why, I tried to prepare a draft code that filters the different markets with a pre-defined criteria. As it is known, Moving Average (MA) is one of the most important indicators for trading. In this tool the filter is applied, if the 30-days-MA is lower than the current price of the stock. This reveals stocks which price has risen and might be interesting candidates to investigate further.
