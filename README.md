Filtering the Market Using Technical Analysis Indicators

S&P 500 (USA), DAX (Germany) and BIST30 (Turkey) are some main indexes from different stock exchanges. Each of them consists of major companies listed in the related stock exchange. The S&P 500, DAX and BIST30 include 500, 30 and 30 companies respectively. Investors or traders can focus on specific stocks and miss other opportunities that also satisfy their conditions.That is why, I tried to prepare a draft code that filters the different markets with a pre-defined criteria. As it is known, Moving Average (MA) is one of the most important indicators for trading. In this tool the filter is applied, if the 50-days-MA is lower than the current price of the stock. This reveals stocks which price has risen and might be interesting candidates to investigate further.
